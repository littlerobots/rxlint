# README

`rxlint` is a set of lint checks that check your [RxJava][1] code. There are currently two checks.

### RxSubscribeOnError

Checks if a [RxJava][1] subscriber is handling the `onError()` callback. 

By default, [RxJava][1] will throw an `OnErrorNotImplemented` exception wrapped in an `IllegalStateException` for every error that is not handled for RxJava 1.x or will call the default uncaught exception handler directly if you are using RxJava 2.x before version 2.0.6.

When subscribing on a [Scheduler][2], like `Schedulers.io()` the error will be thrown on the scheduler thread and the stack trace will have no reference to the place where you subscribed.

TL;DR you should handle `onError`.

### RxLeakedSubscription

Checks that your code keeps a reference to a `Subscription` (rx 1.x) or `Disposable`. Not keeping a reference means that you can't `unsubscribe()` or `dispose()` at the appropriate times which might lead to memory leaks and crashes.

## Using

Adding `rxlint` to your project is easy, just add the following dependency to your `build.gradle`:

```
compile 'nl.littlerobots.rxlint:rxlint:<latest version>'
```

Once added to your project an error will be shown like this:

If you are calling `subscribe()` with a `Subscriber` (rx 1.x) or `DisposableXXXSubscriber` (rx 2.x) the subscriber is not checked for handling errors, and just plain `subscribe()` isn't flagged either. In both cases I assume you know what you are doing :)

### Ignoring errors

Use the `@SuppressLint("RxSubscribeOnError")` annotation, [lint.xml][3] or use `//noinspection AndroidLintCustomError`.
Refer to the [tools documentation on lint][3] for more info.
